# Backwards Compatibility with Early Alpha Versions

The systems for which Spriggit obtains the code to be used when deserializing older versions of Spriggit has been modified heavily since its early days.

`v0.20` introduced a few newer concepts, and is a "bridge" version that contains the old logic and the new logic.

If you have spriggit content that you want to decode from versions before `v0.20`, it is recommended that you download `v0.20` and attempt to do so with that.  Newer versions will not have the logic needed to decode ancient setups.

If you still have issues, swing by the discord, and we'll make sure your files get decoded one way or the other:
