# Spriggit
## Overview
Spriggit is a tool to facilitate converting Bethesda plugin files to a text based format that can be stored in Git. Large scale projects can then live in Github, and accept Pull Requests from many developers.

The goal is to help modders store their files in a versioning system that allows them to easily iterate in the same way that programmers do with their code.

## Reasons to Use Git for Mods
Git is an extremely powerful versioning and iteration tool that almost all programmers use when working.  It's what powers the world of coding to be able to iterate new code quickly and collaborate easily.  

Some things Git can help you do when developing your mod:

- Keep track of the many versions of your mod, without resorting to Dropbox folder hell.
- Create a living "changelog" as you work
- Be able to go back in time and view your mod exactly as it was at any point in history
- Stamp your mod with version tags, letting you see how it looked at any one from the past
- Easily experiment on side branches without worrying your stable setup
- Share your work on Github, allowing people to see your mod's development progress
- Collaborate easily, by allowing others to contribute to your mod via Pull Requests
- More easily merge the work of multiple developers with Git Merge technology
